Mod 2 Project

# PROJECT GOAL

Stakeholders in King County, WA have requested statistical analysis to validate several claims about housing prices in the most recent full calendar year, 2019.

Six of the claims can be addressed directly with the three datasets (from the King County Department of Assessments) described later in this document:

Higher square footage increases home sale price1, 2
Having a porch increases home sale price3, 4
Having a beachfront or lakefront increases home sale price5
The house filling a higher proportion of the overall lot decreases home sale price6
The cost per square foot is lower in duplexes than in single-family homes7
The presence of a nuisance (power lines, traffic noise, airport noise) decreases home sale price1, 5
Three of the claims would require you to seek out additional datasets:

Access to "frequent transit" increases home sale price6
Lower speed limits increase home sale price6
Having an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) increases home sale price6, 8
Your task is to build a linear regression model to represent sales prices in King County, and use it to address some of these claims.
